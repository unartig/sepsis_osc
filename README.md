# Replica Implementation of Adaptively Coupled Phase Oscillators for Sepsis Modeling

In this repository I will gather and share my custom/replica implementations of the Sepsis models described in [Berner et al.](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/network-physiology/articles/10.3389/fnetp.2021.730385/full) and [Sawicki et al.](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/network-physiology/articles/10.3389/fnetp.2022.904480/full).
The current implementation of the simulation is using Jax to (GPU) accelerate the numerical integration calculations (file simulation.py) but can also be run on the CPU.
In the file viz.py an early version of the visualizations can be found.

The whole repository is WIP.
