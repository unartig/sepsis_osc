	            multi-network using the Fisher Information which has been
	            demonstrated in a variety of complex dynamical and thermodynamic
	            systems to provide a lens on critical behaviour and transitions
	            to chaos. Here we use a case-study, introduced elsewhere and thus
	            providing a baseline, of multi-networks consisting of tree and
	            random graphs with couplings and frequencies set at values in the
	            vicinity of thresholds for locking, metastable and chaotic
	            states. We observe transitions in the two-dimensional space of
	            the frustrations in the cross-network interactions of the
	            multi-layer system. While the Shannon entropy consistently
	            identifies a range of transitions, the Fisher Information detects
	            additional signals corresponding to significant changes in the
	            microscopic dynamics. We argue that Fisher Information provides a
	            single measure to analyse rich coupled dynamics and to detect
	            meaningful transitions in a finite-size system that otherwise
	            require multiple measures to establish. We support this analysis
	            using a novel semi-analytical steady-state ansatz incorporating
	            splay phase parameters, where the stability analysis concurs with
	            key changes in the Fisher Information.},

	abstract = {Adaptive dynamical networks appear in various real-word systems.
	            One of the simplest phenomenological models for investigating
	            basic properties of adaptive networks is the system of coupled
	            phase oscillators with adaptive couplings. In this paper, we
	            investigate the dynamics of this system. We extend recent results
	            on the appearance of hierarchical frequency multiclusters by
	            investigating the effect of the time scale separation. We show
	            that the slow adaptation in comparison with the fast phase
	            dynamics is necessary for the emergence of the multiclusters and
	            their stability. Additionally, we study the role of double
	            antipodal clusters, which appear to be unstable for all
	            considered parameter values. We show that such states can be
	            observed for a relatively long time, i.e., they are metastable. A
	            geometrical explanation for such an effect is based on the
	            emergence of a heteroclinic orbit.},
