	            multi-network using the Fisher Information which has been
	            demonstrated in a variety of complex dynamical and thermodynamic
	            systems to provide a lens on critical behaviour and transitions
	            to chaos. Here we use a case-study, introduced elsewhere and thus
	            providing a baseline, of multi-networks consisting of tree and
	            random graphs with couplings and frequencies set at values in the
	            vicinity of thresholds for locking, metastable and chaotic
	            states. We observe transitions in the two-dimensional space of
	            the frustrations in the cross-network interactions of the
	            multi-layer system. While the Shannon entropy consistently
	            identifies a range of transitions, the Fisher Information detects
	            additional signals corresponding to significant changes in the
	            microscopic dynamics. We argue that Fisher Information provides a
	            single measure to analyse rich coupled dynamics and to detect
	            meaningful transitions in a finite-size system that otherwise
	            require multiple measures to establish. We support this analysis
	            using a novel semi-analytical steady-state ansatz incorporating
	            splay phase parameters, where the stability analysis concurs with
	            key changes in the Fisher Information.},
